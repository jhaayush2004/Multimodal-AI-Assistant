# Multimodal AI Assistant

The Multilingual AI Assistant project leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide a versatile assistant capable of handling text, image, and video inputs. Powered by Google's `Gemini-1.5-pro` model and integrated with `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech), `PIL` (Python Imaging Library), and `SpeechRecognition`, this assistant offers a seamless user experience across multiple modalities.

## Why Google Gemini-1.5-pro ?
- At the heart of **Gemini 1.5 Pro's** advancements is its `1M token context window`. This feature allows the model to analyze and understand inputs of unparalleled length, enabling deeper and more nuanced content generation and data analysis.
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro** leverages the `Mixture of Experts (MoE)` architecture, enhancing its ability to process and respond to complex queries efficiently. This architecture allows the model to delegate tasks to specialized components, significantly boosting its performance and versatility.
- With its `vast context window` and advanced architecture, **Gemini 1.5 Pro** demonstrates `superior information retrieval capabilities`. This allows for more precise and relevant outputs, particularly in tasks requiring the extraction of specific information from large datasets.

## Key features

`Multimodal Inputs` : Supports text queries, image uploads, and video submissions for generating informative responses.

`Voice Interaction` : Enables users to interact with the assistant using voice commands, which are processed using SpeechRecognition.

`Real-time Response Generation` : Utilizes Gemini-pro's capabilities to generate context-aware responses in real-time, enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

`Speech Output` : Converts textual responses into audio format using gTTS, allowing users to listen to responses directly.

## Pipeline Workflow

1. **Input Acquisition:**
   - Handles various types of input:
     - Voice input converted to text using SpeechRecognition.
     - Textual queries entered directly by the user.
     - Multimedia uploads (images and videos) managed through Streamlit.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Processes input data:
     - Audio data handled by PyAudio for voice inputs.
     - Images processed using PIL to prepare them for model input.
     - Videos managed and processed via Streamlit for subsequent operations.

3. **Model Execution:**
   - Utilizes Google's generative AI services (google-generativeai):
     - Receives processed inputs (text, images, videos).
     - Generates responses or content based on the received inputs.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - Converts generated text responses into speech:
     - gTTS used to generate audio output from textual responses.
     - Audio files made available for listening and download through Streamlit.
